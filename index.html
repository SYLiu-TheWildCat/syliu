                <h4>Abstract:</h4>In this <a href="files/Siyang Liu, Floer theory for Lagrangian Intersections.pdf">thesis</a> we give an exposition of Arnold's conjecture on Lagrangian intersections, which was one of the main topics in late 1980s. We will mainly focus on Floer's proof under the topological condition $\pi_2 (P,L)=0$, given in his series of papers, with some slight generalizations made by precessors in most of the parts of the proof.
            <br>    
                &nbsp;&nbsp; In the first section we give a brief introduction to the history of Arnold conjecture, including its origin: the Poincar\'e's last geometric theorem, how it was proposed by Arnold in his 1965 paper \cite{Arnold1965}, and a summary of his first exposition on this problem.
            <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp; Then we present Floer's approach to this Arnold conjecture. In the second section we apply variation to an action functional and derive the Cauchy-Riemann equation on a pseudo-holomorphic strip, which indicates the trajectories associated to this action functional. We prove that this trajectories tend to critical points as expected.
            <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp; The third section is the main part of this paper. We construct the Floer chain complex and prove that this is exactly a chain complex so that we could take the cohomology. This step requires much techniques from non-linear analysis and some study of non-linear elliptic partial differential equations. Some of the technical part is presented in the appendix.
            <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp; Finally in the last section, we show that the given cohomology is independent of the choice of some generic structures along the process we construct the chain complex, so is actually a topological invariant. We could then reduce to the easiest case of a ``classical'' phase space and prove that the Floer cohomology group is isomorphic to the Morse cohomology group, hence proving the Arnold conjecture.</div></li>

                        <li><b>Abstract: </b>Motivated from Heegaard-Floer theory, Lauda-Licata-Manion proposed a conjecture relating symplectic geometry of hyperplane arrangements to representation theory of hypertoric varieties.

                        <li><b>Abstract:</b> In this talk, I’ll explain our recent work studying the symplectic topology of complements of complexified hyperplane arrangements. When hyperplanes intersect transversely, we proved that symplectic handles can be found essentially from the intersection points of the hyperplanes. If time permits, I’ll also discuss the strategy of extending the result to general hyperplane arrangements.

                        <li><b>Abstract:</b> In this talk, I'll advertise our recent work in progress on studying degenerations of Weinstein manifolds. We will show that under degeneration, Weinstein manifolds undergo handle detachments where the detaching data is given by cocores that are not fixed by the monodromy action. The corresponding symplectic invariant, e.g. the wrapped Fukaya category, will undergo a localization, or quotient by the monodromy action. As a byproduct, an inductive handle structure of a family of degenerations will also be shown. This is joint work in preparation with Sheel Ganatra, Wenyuan Li and Peng Zhou.</li>

                        <li><b>Abstract:</b> In this talk we will discuss a symplectic model for T-equivariant hypertoric category \mathscr{O} as constructed by Braden-Licata-Proudfoot-Webster, which is the Fukaya-Seidel category of complexified complement of hyperplane arrangements associated to the corresponding hypertoric variety. This would provide a categorification of K-theoretic stable envelopes for hypertoric varieties. This is partly based on the recent work collaborated with S. Lee, Y. Li and C. Y. Mak and the work in preparation with S. Ganatra, W. Li and P. Zhou.</li>
